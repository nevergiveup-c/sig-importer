# Signature Importer

## Description:
IDA Pro 9.x Plugin that automatically transfers the progress between dumps by using special *.json file that defines a number of fields for finding and signing addresses. 
The provided plugin is a PET project developed while learning IDA SDK C++.

## Requirements:
IDA Pro 9.x **only**

## Installation:
Put it into plugins folder of **your** IDA installation.

## Usage:

Launch the plugin by pressing hotkey (by default “**Ctrl+Shift+F10**”) or via **Edit -> Plugin -> Signature Importer**. Select the search area in the window appeared, for large binaries “Segment only” is recommended.

If you select “Segment only” you will need to enter the segment name (default is .text). When selecting “Global” segment selection is skipped and we proceed to the next step.

![Step 1](images/usage_step_1.png)

Select *.json with signatures and wait for the search and signing to complete.

### JSON Configuration Format

The plugin uses JSON files to define signature patterns and their associated metadata. Each pattern is an object in a JSON array.

#### Field Reference

| Field                      | Required | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|----------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `signature`                | + | string | Byte pattern with wildcards (`?` or `??` for unknown bytes)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `name`                     | - | string | Sets name for function/variable at the found address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `declaration`              | - | string | Sets function/variable type and name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `comment`                  | - | string | Adds comment to address or function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `color`                    | - | number | Sets background color (RGB value in decimal format)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `operations`               | - | array | Array with data (`offset`, `insn_format`) for calculating final effective address. Possible fields: offset, insn_format. Fields can be arranged in any order and repeated.Operations executed sequentially from lower to higher index                                                |
| `operations[].offset`      | - | number | Is used for calculating final effective address by using basic operation (to current address += offset)                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `operations[].insn_format` | - | array | Is used for obtaining relative offset. Calculation is performed as follows: for instruction at 0x1000 `"E8 12 34 56 78"` with format `[1,4]`: `rip = 0x1000 + 1 + 4`, `rel_offset = read_dword(0x1000 + 1)`, `final_address = rip + rel_offset`                                      |
| `breakpoint`               | - | array | Breakpoint configuration `[exist, type, size]`. Type: 0=software+execute (default), 1=write, 2=read, 3=read/write, 4=software, 8=execute, 12=default. Size is irrelevant for software breakpoints. For hardware breakpoints size matters but can't always be set to arbitrary values |
